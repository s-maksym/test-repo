oFirst, repo has to be created on github (or use curl)

Local folder setup:
git init
--- 
git add #files to staging area
git commit -m "Message"
git remote add origin /url/https://github.com/user/repo.git
git push -u origin master

Branching:
git branch -a #to show all branches
git fetch -p #to refetch branches and delete nonexisting remotely
git checkout -b "branch name" #to change, or create and change, local branch
git push -u origin lclname:rmname #push to selected non-lclnamed branch
git push origin ... #push to tracked
git branch -d lclbranch #delete lclbranch
git push origin --delete rmbranch #rm remote branch
